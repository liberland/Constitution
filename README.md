# üèõÔ∏è Introduction - Constitution

This repository chronicles the drafting of the Liberland Constitution. Until the Constitution is drafted and adopted in a referendum, the [Articles of the Provisional Government](articles-of-the-provisional-government-of-liberland.md) of Liberland act as the supreme law of the land.

Please visit **[Discussions](https://github.com/liberland/Constitution/discussions)** to propose changes and new institutes. You can open new **[issues](https://github.com/liberland/Constitution/issues)** to notify us about a possible problem or a need for a change.

Drafting takes place in a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RYgEHcb2oMgYJOa2MWUxe8E0aHRIgDpsiMG21MACIVg/edit#heading=h.fp3y74i7s4wi). The various milestones are then converted to markdown and uploaded to this repository, and same for the final draft. The Constitution shall take force after Liberland Citizens adopt it in a future referendum.

The current version of the Constitution [is here](https://github.com/liberland/constitution/blob/master/Constitution.md).
